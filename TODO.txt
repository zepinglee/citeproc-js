Do something for stop-words and quoted titles, and journal names
(pretty-much done, needs check against threads below):

Refine handling of names, with flexible style-specific handling for
Myanmar, Japanese, Mongolian, etc.

  cs:style-options name-as-sort-order="ja zh kr my" (done)
  cs:style-options name-never-short="ja zh kr my"   (done)

  cs:style-options multilingual-suppress-tag="ja" multilingual-suppress-family="names"
  (??? or somesuch)

The explicit name-as-sort-order and name-never-short options take
precedence over the regexp-based guesswork.

Fix this one:
