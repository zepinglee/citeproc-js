# TODO

## Completion of feature set

- Get locators working in test suite and via RPC demo.

- Provide HTML validation for inline markup.  Return the
  string with stray markers in HTML-escaped form.  This
  will display the field in the form it will appear in
  the document.

- Provide a "divide" method that splits a string into 
  "mutable" and "preserve" forks, with index hints to
  be used in recombine the two forks using a "conquer"
  method.  Or something.  This recombinant stuff will be
  slick when implemented, but there are lots of sharp
  objects in our path.

- Provide discrete handling for "function" and "tag" types
  of decoration.  The latter work as at present, with
  simple nested application.  The former will require
  the divide and conquer mechanism described above,
  and will apply only to the "mutable" fork of the
  string.

- For inline markup, do not recognize purely presentational
  elements at top level; require semantic markup tags around
  everything that is to be specially formatted.  Stray
  presentational tags to be rendered as tag literals.

- Tidy up and finish out API, provide examples and
  an overview readme doc.

- Various options and special formatting attributes need to be
  implemented, none of which seem particularly scarey.
    (a very short list of these remain.  fbennett 2009-04-11)


## Possible proposals for CSL

- Localized date formatting?
