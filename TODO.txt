<if locator="chapter"/> etc may not be implemented.  Needs a test.

Parallel snooping is probably not working on getSortKeys, and it needs
to do.  Where there is a second ibid backreference to a source within
the same cite, backreferencing will break, at least when the site is
first created.  The flagging of parallels to the external positioning
machinery has to be done in the sort, not in the rendering function.
No need to mangle the output in that case; but it needs to be snooped
and flagged.
