========================
Changes in version 1.2.3
========================

* Adjust a test to reflect new modulare style logic
  (Jurism US module now renders only authority, not jurisdiction,
  in the legal_case type)

* Send raw institution keys to abbrevs filter
  (Using raw machine-readable keys was always the right way,
  human-readable form should not have been used for this)

* Recognize "division" as a numeric variable

* Broaden French subtitle split condition in multiple subtitles to include ? and !

* Tweaks for narrow no-break-space in fr locale

* Remove unused flags from state.js

* More generous subtitle capitalization

* Tests of new title split/subtitle caps code

========================
Changes in version 1.2.2
========================

- Enable build-time flag for uppercasing subtitles in sentence case
  rendering. Flag is a setting on the Sys object that provides
  retriveItem and other goodies to the processor:

    var sys = {
      retrieveItem: function(id) {
        // return item
      },
      ...
      uppercase_subtitles = true
    }
    var citeproc = CSL.Engine(sys, styleCSL);


========================
Changes in version 1.2.1
========================

- Align disambig priorities with spec by default.

  The CSL Specification calls for year-suffix to be applied before
  disambiguate="true" conditions are tried. `citeproc-js` previously
  applied these in the opposite order by default, but from this
  version, default behavior is aligned with the spec.

  The previous behavior can be restored with the following setting
  on the `sys` object fed to the processor at instantiation:

    sys.prioritize_default_condition = true;

- A number of tests that are specific to `citeproc-js` have been
  moved from the `test-suite` CSL repository to citepro-js
  `fixtures/local`.
