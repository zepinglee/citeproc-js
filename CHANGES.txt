Summary of changes to citeproc-js since version 1.0.0 release.

=========================
Changes in version 1.0.13
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Drop standard test fixture data from citeproc-js source repository.

- Adjust test runner test.py to accomodate the directory structure of
  the standalone copy of the test fixtures.

- Add note on the need to add the test fixtures manually to the README.txt 
  file and the processor manual.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.12
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix bug in optional date parser code affecting ranged
  Japanese dates.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Separate local and standard test fixtures, and make necessary
  adjustments to test framework.

- Drop test subdirectories "bundled" and "run" from mercurial.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.11
=========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Processor now opens a key entry in the abbreviation lists for any 
  field value for which abbreviation is requested, but unavailable.
  This should provide enough to get a circle-of-goodness thing
  going to start crowdsourcing style-specific abbreviation lists.


=========================
Changes in version 1.0.10
=========================

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Checking in bundled code for the last change, upping version
  in processor code.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.9
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Cause processor to report its own version as processor_version,
  and the supported CSL version as csl_version.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.8
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix code incompatible with IE6 in util_dateparser.js.

- Fix error in the code for generating year-suffix strings
  (fixes bug affecting very high values unlikely to be encountered
  in actual operation).

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Various small fixes in the tests/citeproc_js processor
  tests directory to get tests working with current version
  of code.

- Make syntax and formatting adjustments to recent code as
  recommended by jslint.

- Fix invalid CSL in one test.

- Drop some extraneous files from the archive.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.7
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Place name suffix after the given name is name-as-sort-order
  rendering, separated by a comma, as required by CMS.

- Provide for quote-escaping of name field parsing, when the
  citeproc-js specific parse-names toggle is used to invoke
  name field pre-parsing.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Tests of citeproc-js name parsing extension, with CMS-correct
  handling of name suffixes.

- Fix placement of name suffix in several tests.

- Move parseName() function from build.js to util_names.js.  

- Test for quote-escaped particles in the family name with name field
  parsing.

- Update to manual to cover the citeproc-js parsing conventions for
  name particles and suffixes.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.6
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Drop suffix from short form of names.

- Use implicit context-sensitive joins (space or comma + space)
  when the cs:et-al element is used in a name (i.e. align behavior
  of this element with behavior of the implicit "et al." term, as
  required by the amended CSL specification).

- Permit use of "initials" with non-byzantine names, when style requires
  initialization of a name.  Will allow truncation of Japanese given
  names to the first character, as required by some book publisher
  styles in Japan, and possibly in other Asian-script domains.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Move a test specific to citeproc-js to citeprocjs group.

- Adjust tests to require implicit application of comma + space prefix
  to et al. term, when cs:et-al is used.

- Simplify handling of "et-al" and "with" joins, eliminating a couple
  of nesting levels.  Preliminary infrastructure for discriminate
  handling of "et-al" and "and" terms with institutional names.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.5
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Give name suffixes the same formatting as the family
  name-part.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.4
========================

-----------
Enhancement
-----------

- Fix articulars preceded by a comma (as Bennett's own name)
  to render correctly in bibliographies, as "Bennett, Frank G., Jr.".

---------------------------
Minor interface adjustments
---------------------------

- Change the "comma_suffix" key used to indicate that a name suffix
  should be preceded by a comma to "comma-suffix", for consistency.


-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix manual to reflect minor interface adjustments made in 1.0.1 and 
  1.0.4 releases, and to mention the "hereinafter" section of the
  abbreviations object, previously overlooked.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.3
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Use comma + space for delimiter before implicit et al. term, when
  preceded by more than one personal name.  Brings processor behav ior
  into line with current Zotero processor and common style
  requirements.  Context sensitivity is not available with explicit et
  al. term; tha t issue to be addressed in CSL 1.1.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.2
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Fix errors in the placement of non-dropping particles.

- Fix placement of particles in short-form names.

-------
Cleanup
-------

- Fix invalid CSL in test fixtures.


========================
Changes in version 1.0.1
========================

------------------------------------
Mishandled or unimplemented features
------------------------------------

- Return maxoffset and the value of second-field-align itself in the
  header of the return value from makeBibliography() when
  second-field-align is used.

- Correctly set the value of entry-spacing and line-spacing, providing
  for a default value of 1 for both attributes, and permitting them
  to be set to 0.

- Set position to subsequent rather than ibid on cites for which one
  or more notes stand between the current citation and the preceding
  partner.

- Implement and test the baseline value for vertical-align.

- Recognize first-reference-note-number as a variable attribute value
  on cs:if and cs:else-if.  Wake up locator attribute on cs:if and
  cs:else-if.

- Fix uppercasing of terms when rendered at first position, and
  prevent uppercasing otherwise.

- Use a space rather than space + comma as the delimiter preceding
  an implicit et-al term.

- Return entry_ids in the header returned by makeBibliography().  The
  entry_ids value is a list, in turn containing one list per entry
  (the nested list being necessary to provide for parallel citations
  picked up in the bibliography).

- Support for uncited items, via new updateUncitedItems() command.

-----------
Fine tuning
-----------

- Suppress issued year if it matches the volume number exactly.  This
  effect is needed for UK case cites.  It's an exception, so other
  content must take priority; the change comes out if it causes
  problems elsewhere.

- Fixes in node_names.js to make institutional names handling available in note styles.

- In what I think is a harmless divergence from the specification,
  return true for is-numeric for non-numeric variables that end in a
  number.  Some styles require adjustment of joins, such as the
  insertion of a comma, in this case.

- Taint items for a change in sequence number only if citation-number
  is used in the citation.

---------------------------------
Fixes to parallels detection code
---------------------------------

- Fix array overrun bug in parallel detection code.

- When the trailing year is quashed in a cite in initial position
  within a set, quash it also in the final partner.  Needed to
  handle public domain citations.

- Provide looser constraint on minimum variable content for parallels
  detection.  Provide for adding a constraint on item type.

- Eliminate am_master flag, and instead rely on the position of the
  rendered item under analysis within the cite set.  This works after
  eliminating and extraneous cite set list push operation that was
  causing it to fail.

-----------------
Internal bugfixes
-----------------

- Suppress registration of names that do not include a family name.

- Provide for the possibility that subsequent citation forms will not
  include any names, and therefore not produce disambiguation data in
  the registry.

- Avoid rendering of citation numbers when evaluating subsequent cites
  for disambiguation purposes, in node_text.js

- Fix a subtle bug in the rollback of added names, in
  disambig_cites.js.

- Companion changes in node_names.js and cmd_cite.js, to restore
  parameters based on subsequent-form disambiguation to the registry,
  after rendering a first-position cite.

- Fix bug caused by incomplete cs:choose node set as a helper for
  cs:substitute.

- Rename citationIdByItemId to citationsByItemId, and adjust code to
  set this list with pointers instead of IDs.  Leverage availability
  of citation pointers to get near-note conditional working.

---------------------------
Minor interface adjustments
---------------------------

- Extend abbreviations structure with addition sections
  "title", "publisher", and "publisher-place".  Change names of
  abbreviation sections "journal" and "series" to "container-title"
  and "collection-title" respectively, for consistency and clarity.


-------
Cleanup
-------

- Delete tests which, if they had been correctly written, would have
  been invalid CSL.

- Fix tests involving et-al-subsequent-min and
  et-al-subsequent-use-first that were either incorrectly written or
  required a wrong result.

- Align abbreviation list keys with field names in tests.

- Cleanup and reorganization of code related to multi-lingual handling
  and abbreviations.

- Adjust near-note tests to use a simple boolean value on the cite
  supplement element of the item, rather than a note distance.

- Adjust tests to reflect correct lowercasing of ibid term when not at
  first position.

- Change tests to use a space rather than comma+space before et al.
