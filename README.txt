This is an effort to implement a full-featured standalone CSL
processor in Javascript, for use by the Zotero project, and by other
sites and platforms that can benefit from a standard method of
formatting citation data.

Please see the manual, either in the ./manual subdirectory
under the name citeproc-doc.rst, or online at
http://gsl-nagoya-u.net/http/pub/citeproc-doc.html for
details of this program.

Enjoy!
